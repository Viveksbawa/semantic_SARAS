#Semantic segmentation using PSPNet, OCNet and DANet

This is the implementation of semantic image segmentation system. The Neural Network architecture used for segmentation is divided into two components: Encoder and Decoder

This repo contains Resnet based encoder: Resnet50, Resnet 101, ResNest 50, ResNest 101, Resnest 200
and the decoder implemented are: PSPNet, OCNet and DANet.


* The module has training pipelines for ADE20K and Cityscape datasets
* Each has
